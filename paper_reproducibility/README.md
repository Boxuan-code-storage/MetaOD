## Supplementary Material: Automating Outlier Detection via Meta-Learning

The environment here is solely for reproducibility, other than industry use.

**Due to the GitHub file size limit, please see the full env (with datasets)** @
[Google Drive](https://tinyurl.com/metaod). **On GitHub, we supply code only**. 

To run the demo, first install the required libraries by executing
"pip install -r requirements.txt". It is working with Python 3.6+.

POC and ST testbeds are provided in separate folders with datasets and the demo code.
To run demo in POC testbed, navigate to POC folder and execute: 
"python demo_POC.py".

Similarly, tp run demo in ST testbed, navigate to ST folder and execute:
"python demo_ST.py".
